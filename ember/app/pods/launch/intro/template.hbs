This is commonly referred to as a "Minimum Viable Product" or M.V.P.
(more info)

The goal of the M.V.P. is to invest
the minimum amount necessary in order to observe if your bet is likely to pay off.

Let's face it, implementing any solution to a problem can be expensive and
you're betting that the solution either makes or saves you more money than the alternative.
This is where an M.V.P. comes in handy.  The goal of producing an M.V.P. is to invest the minimum
amount necessary in order to observe if your bet is likely to pay off.
At this phase of the project, we "cheat the system" in order to gain more information.
What do we mean by "cheating the system"?  Well, a solution may only be deployed to a few
people, or we may adopt some manual process, or we may sacrifice R.A.M quality metrics.

Don't let that scare you though.  Because we are moving so fast, it is easy to fix problems,
adjust our approach, and get feedback from stakeholders all while minimizing your investment
in any one solution.
